I have decided to use this [database](https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/blob/master/pokedex.json) and create a server to provide data for the frontend.

## how to run:
1. the project is divided into client and server
2. Run Server: 
   * `$ cd server`
   * `$ npm install`
   * `$ node server.js`
   * go to localhost:8000

3. Run client:
   The built tool is [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) by facebook.
   * `$ cd client`
   * `$ npm install` # It will take time to install)
   * `$ npm start` # It's slow to start, but able to do hot-reload, effortlessly :)  
   app will run at localhost:3000 in development mode
