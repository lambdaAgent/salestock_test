# This repo is created for SaleStock_test
this repo is created for salestock_test, the [pokeapi](http://www.pokeapi.co/) requires captcha to access it.
I have decided to use this [database](https://github.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/blob/master/pokedex.json) and create a server to provide for the frontend.

## how to run:
1. the project is divided into client and server
2. Run Server: 
   * `$ cd server`
   * `$ npm install`
   * `$ node server.js`
3. Run client:
   * `$ cd client`
   * `$ npm start`
